# Data sources

*Data*: \
`Table A-1`, `Table A-2` and `Table A-7` from https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-273.html \
`Table A-1` from https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2019/demo/income-poverty/p60-266.html \
`Table A-1` from https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-263.html \


The data is from the United States Census Bureau.
In this project, we are interested in changes in income from multiple dimension.
The first point we focus on is disparities in income by Race and Ethnicity, and how does location affect income?\
The second question we can observe from our data is trends in the income distribution by race/ethnicity over a period of time.\
Another noteworthy point is explaining trend in gender wage gap.\


The three `Tables A-1` show the same information in the column such as Race and Ethnicity, location, education, etc. The only difference among them is time. So we will put them together and analyze the data from time series and cross-section directions.\
`Table A-2` and `Table A-7` are time-series data from 1960 to 2020. `Table A-2` separates the household income into 9 groups and show the number of household by different race group. `Table A-7` compares the income for females and males.\
All these three tables are informational and can support our three questions.
