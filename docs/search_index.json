Meanwhile, the excessive income disparity has also led to a series of consequences, posing serious challenges for future socioeconomic development. Inclusive economic growth is not only a value orientation of social justice but also a necessity for sustainable economic growth and social stability. Most people would agree with reducing the income disparity gap, so it is worthy to understand what is causing the income disparity gap between rich and poor in order to reduce it. In this analysis, we focus on cross-sectional comparisons of median income with genders over time, and longitudinal comparisons of key factors (e.g. race, region, household type, education, age) with income over the same time period. This statistical graphical analysis can help us answer the question of the growing gap between men’s and women’s income inequality, the influence of race and ethnicity on income, income variation of different households and etc. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Data: We collect data sets from United States Census Bureau and United Nations Development Program. Totally, we have 6 data sets: 1. Table A-1, Table A-2 and Table A-7 from https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-273.html 2. Table A-1 from https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2019/demo/income-poverty/p60-266.html 3. Table A-1 from https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-263.html 4. Share of Employment in Nonagriculture for Female (% of total employment in nonagriculture) from UNDP human development report https://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/175106 The three Tables A-1 show the same information in the column such as Race and Ethnicity, location, education, etc. The only difference among them is time. So we will put them together and analyze the data from time series and cross-section directions. Table A-2 and Table A-7 are time-series data from 1960 to 2020. Table A-2 separates the household income into 9 groups and show the number of household by different race group. Table A-7 compares the income of females and males. Shape of Employment in Nonagricultural for Female represents the data during 1991-2019 and it contains the employment proportion of female in nonagricultural industry in 180 countries, in five different type of human developments and in 10 different regions. According to time, the three Table A-1 have name data_15_16, data_17_18 and data_19_20 in this report. Table A-2 and Table A-7 are called house_67_20 and fm_ern respectively. The Shape of Employment in Nonagricultural for Female can easily separate the data to three different sheets, the split method will show after. All of them are informational and support our project; however, the majority of data sets are not readable for programming. Our first step in this project is to transform and clean these data. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 The Transformation Process for fm_ern 3.2 The Transformation Process for house_67_20 3.3 The Transformation Process for data_15_16, data_17_18 and data_19_20 3.4 The transformation process for Shape of Employment in Nonagricultural for Female", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 The Transformation Process for fm_ern In fm_ern, since the raw data was collected in excel format, which contains text description in the first and last few rows, these unhelpful rows are deleted first. When reading the excel into R, the column names are default defined as some values, renaming column names is the next step to create data easier for understanding. In the “Year” column of the original data, some cells have corner scales, and after looking into the data we can conclude this is not significant because only two years appear twice, so the first row occurred from each duplicated “Year” is selected. Last, since the margin of error is not taken into consideration in this analysis, getting rid of columns associated with the margin of error is the last step. 3.2 The Transformation Process for house_67_20 In house_67_20, we first delete the uncorrelated descriptive text rows as fm_ern, then rename the column name. In the original excel data set, the race is categorized by row, so we deleted the row indicated race and add a new race column at the end to make the data set suitable for graphics in ggplot2. 3.3 The Transformation Process for data_15_16, data_17_18 and data_19_20 In the data_15_16, this data demonstrate income by different factors like household, education, race, etc. All factors show in one row, so we separate the data by each category to analyze how each factor contributes to median_income. In the categorized data set, renaming the columns and adding a new column for the sub-categories. Since data_17_18 and data_19_20 have the same data structure as data_15_16. The transformation process for data_17_18 and data_19_20 applies the same strategy. 3.4 The transformation process for Shape of Employment in Nonagricultural for Female This data was originally collected with neatness. It is easy to figure out that the data shows the employment proportion of females in the nonagricultural industry in three different categories: countries, type of human development and region. First, according to the category, the report splits the original data into three sheets and gives the names emp_fe, hum_dev and region for them. Then, these sheets need simply to delete some un-used rows in excel since it does not require many transformations. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values After inspecting all transformed data sets, it is good to see only fm_ern has missing values and the number of missing data isn’t large. Also, the majority of missing values gather in the period of 1960-1966, which is less important in this data set. Though some values are missing in 1960-1966, there are still 5 column containing complete data can be still used to study the median earning of different genders. So, the report don’t dispose the missing value in 1960-1966 in this part. In year 1974, there are two missing values in the “ft_workers_num_male” and “ft_workers_num_male” . From observing the data, the similar year has similar value, thus the report fills these two value by using the mean of the worker number from previous and next year. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Gender Influence in Income 5.2 Race influence in Income 5.3 Other Influence in Income", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Gender Influence in Income To study the trend of women’s employment situation, the complex data can be depicted easily by using the geographical chart to compare the female share of employment in nonagricultural of the early time period and now. The interaction part allows users to observe data by their needs. The scales of graphs for 1991 and 2019 are different, but people can still observe that women actively participate in nonagricultural employment in North America, East Asia, Europe and Oceania. For example, no obvious difference between 1991 and 2019 in countries like Canada and Russia. An increasing female share trend of employment appears most significantly in South Asia, then in South Africa and South America. For example, the share in Iran grows to 17.3 from 9.8, with great growth also in countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc. People can also see the gentle growth in countries like Argentina and South Africa. One interesting point in this graph is the number in India decreases to 15.9 from 16.4. There probably have three key factors that limit the role of women in the Indian economy - entrenched gender discrimination; increased earnings for men; and lack of high-quality employment opportunities for women. Even the worldwide increased female employment cannot solve this dilemma. Another guess is those highly-educated women going abroad to seek better job opportunities. To represent the time-series data, the report uses the line plot to see the changes from 1991 to 2019. All the curves in this graph are relatively smooth with a low slope, so it is clear that the women’s share of non-agricultural employment only gains very subtle growth worldwide. Also, the statistics of the world and small island developing states are far lower than other regions in the world. As a result, there is still a long way to achieve the goal of gender equality in the workplace. These two graphs are used to study the difference between female and male median earnings by full-time and total workers. Comparing the disparity of genders, both female median earnings by full time and total median earnings are lower than male ones. From another perspective, comparing full-time and total workers, it is easy to see that full-time workers earn more than total workers. One reason for this difference is the total workers may contain some unpaid situation. The second graph helps us work on the question of the difference in median earnings by gender. No significant difference between full-time workers and total workers here, and it is glad to see that the gap in earning difference for gender is narrower as time goes by. The last point of study on the gender earnings inequality is based on the number of workers. In the upper graph, both curves for the total number of workers are high than the full-time ones. It is easily perceived since the full-time workers have to be a subset of the total number of workers. In the lower graph, we can see both curves show a decreasing trend in the difference of numbers of workers in the workplace, which follows the result of the times series graph on a narrower wage gap between females and males, which is a good sign as well. 5.2 Race influence in Income Here the report chooses to use bar plots to see how races affect income by finding the location of the peak in the distribution. The patterns of WHITE ALONE and WHITE ALONE_NOT HISPANIC are quite similar, located in the upper-middle-income range, which is at its peak around “50-75” and “100-150”. Also, there is not much difference in ASIAN ALONE OR IN COMBINATION and ASIAN ALONE as well, the income ranges gather in the top-level “above 200”. The same pattern appears in BLACK ALONE and BLACK ALONE OR IN COMBINATION, which is highest in “Under 15”. The income range varied by race is easily detectable by the observation by faceting bar plots. From the horizontal comparison of time, all race shows an increasing trend in the median income. Especially, there is a steep slope between the year 2018 and 2019. However, From the year 2019 to 2020, the median income of all races decrease. The outbreak of COVID-19 may explain this phenomenon. A lot of companies face the breakout problem and usually, they cut down the number of persons employed to relieve the financial stress. 5.3 Other Influence in Income After considering some key factors’ influence on income, the report is still interested in how other possible factors could affect median income. As the time-series graph showing, people can see an overall increasing trend in income by different households, but they’re all exists a simultaneous decrease from 2019 to 2020. The reason for this is the COVID-19 virus can affect everyone’s earnings no matter the household type. We can see from the graph that the higher one’s earnings are, the greater the influence of the COVID-19. The household type of “Married-couple” earns the most and was affected the most. Education is another factor worth taking consideration into. This bar plot compares not only the influence of education on median income but also an increase in income from 2019 to 2020 for all educational levels. People can conclude from the graph that earnings accumulate greatly as the educational level increases. The last factor the report assume has a great impact on earnings is age. The report uses bar charts to compare from both among and within each age group. A normal distribution can be observed from the median income as age grows. Within each group, the median income rises with time, and a hit of the COVID-19 can be discovered here as well because there is a sudden decline from 2019 to 2020. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component In this part, the report represents the interactive plot for the proportion of females in the nonagricultural industry from 1991 to 2019 with break 5. People can observe countries, such as China, the United States, Russia, etc., that has a higher proportion of female in the nonagricultural industry still maintain the higher proportion. This proportion grows fast in some African countries such as South Africa, Angola, Botswana, etc. In 2019, these countries have a similar proportion to those countries that show high value in 1991. Some Asian countries that are close to Africa, such as India, Iran, Pakistan, etc., continuously have a lower proportion of females in the nonagricultural industry. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion From the exploratory analysis of each factor’s impact on income and employment, we can conclude the following points. First, the rising female share of non-agricultural employment and income is a global trend. Women are trying hard to gain their fair share of power in the workplace worldwide. From this report, the difference of median income among different races can be found, but the good news is all races have an increasing trend in their income before the outbreak of the COVID-19. This increasing trend for income also shows in different types of households. Higher Education can gain higher income. The age group from 45 to 54 has the highest median income. COVID-19 is mentioned a lot of times in this report and through the analysis, it is clear to see that the pandemic has been influencing people’s lives economically.
