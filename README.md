My awesome book

income variation project 
The first point we focus on is disparities in income by Race and Ethnicity, and how does location affect income?
The second question we can observe from our data is trends in the income distribution by race/ethnicity over a period of time?
Another noteworthy point is explaining trend in gender wage gap?
